This work explores the mental impacts of video games on the human brain. It focuses on 
the knowledge, emotional, and behavioral factors experienced by gamers. The objective is 
to examine the intricate relationship between video games and the brain. This will shed 
light on the potential benefits and possible hazards connected with prolonged gaming 
sessions. 
The cognitive effects of video games cover concentration, observation, retention, and 
analytical skills. Research suggests that certain genres of video games, such as action and 
strategy games, can enhance cognitive abilities, including spatial logical thinking, juggling 
multiple tasks, and decision-making. However, it should be highlighted that excessive 
gaming can have negative effects on mental health and social interactions. Apprehending 
the cognitive outcomes of video games on the brain is crucial for optimizing their potential 
benefits. The importance of this cannot be overstated and is also important for mitigating 
potential risks.  Video games have been discovered to exhibit significant psychological 
effects on the brain, cognition, emotion, and behavior. One area that worries is gaming 
addiction, where individuals become excessively attached to playing video games. On the 
other hand, video games demonstrate positive effects on cognitive enhancement and 
emotional regulation. Additionally, video games offer chances for social interaction, both 
online and offline.
